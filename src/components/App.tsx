//useEffect is a hook that lets you run side effects after rendering
//the component. A side effect is any code that affects something outside
//of the component, such as updating the document title.

//This useEffect hook sets the document title to "My Portfolio" when the
//component is rendered. The second argument to useEffect is an array
//of dependencies. When any of the dependencies change, useEffect will
//re-run. In this case, the dependency array is title, so the effect 
//will run when the 'Refresh Portfolio' button is pressed
//if array is left empty we would only run useEffect onMount
const [title, setTitle] = useState('My Portfolio');

//--maybe a job board page? Or project idea page??
